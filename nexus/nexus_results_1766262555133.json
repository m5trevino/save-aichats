PRIME DIRECTIVE**\nDiagnose and execute a structural restoration of a 1992 Fleetwood RV entry door by addressing systemic water ingress and internal wood rot within its vacuum-bonded composite sandwich construction.\n\n**2. CORE ENGINE**\nThe objective is to stop the \"Gravitational Rot Cycle\" caused by failed window seals and restore the structural integrity of the door's \"meat\" (internal wood blocking) to ensure the latch and hinges can safely support the assembly's weight.\n\n**3. TECHNICAL DNA**\n*   **System Architecture:** Vacuum-Bonded Composite Lamination (Sandwich Method).\n*   **Frame (The Exoskeleton):** Extruded Aluminum C-Channel perimeter; features radius (rounded) corners at the top.\n*   **Core (Insulation):** Expanded Polystyrene (white styrofoam); provides 90% of volume for insulation and weight reduction but offers zero structural screw-holding strength.\n*   **Structural Blocking (The Skeleton):** Raw pine or low-grade plywood blocks embedded in foam at high-stress coordinates (Latch Zone, Hinge Zone, Window Perimeter).\n*   **Skins (The Shell):** Exterior is Filon (smooth fiberglass) or pebbled aluminum; Interior is thin Luan plywood with a vinyl wallpaper veneer.\n*   **Bonding Agent:** Industrial contact cement or urethane adhesive fused via pinch-rolling or vacuum-bonding.\n*   **Failure Indicators:**\n    *   \"The Fleetwood Crunch\": Flexing of the door skin when the handle is pulled.\n    *   Rust on window frame screws (indicates internal moisture pooling).\n    *   Stripped/loose screws in the latch or hinge zones.\n*   **Repair Logic:**\n    *   **Phase 1 (Stabilization):** Removal of window assembly, extraction of failed butyl tape, and surface cleaning with mineral spirits.\n    *   **Phase 2 (Surgical):** Manual delamination of the interior Luan skin using a wide putty knife.\n    *   **Phase 3 (Excision):** Removal of \"black/rotten\" internal wood blocking.\n    *   **Phase 4 (Reconstruction):** Replacement with new wood; recommendation for marine-grade plywood or epoxy-sealed lumber.\n    *   **Phase 5 (Fusion):** Re-bonding skin with urethane-expanding glue (e.g., Gorilla Glue) or construction adhesive (Liquid Nails Fuze*It).\n    *   **Phase 6 (Calibration):** Precision clamping and weighting to prevent door twist/warp during the curing cycle.\n\n**4. CONSTRAINTS & RISKS**\n*   **Proprietary Geometry:** Fleetwood-specific sizing makes modern off-the-shelf replacements difficult/impossible to source.\n*   **Material Degradation:** 30-year-old UV-exposed plastic window frames are prone to cracking during removal.\n*   **Precision Risk:** Failure to clamp the door perfectly flat during the bonding phase will result in a twisted door that cannot achieve a weather-tight seal.\n*   **Safety Risk:** The \"clamp pressure\" of the window frame is essential; if the internal wood is mush, the window can theoretically fall out or leak further.\n\n**5. INTEL VAULT: Non-Technical Assets for Later Extraction**\n*   **Asset Identity:** Confirmed as a 1992 Fleetwood (likely a Tioga, Jamboree, or Bounder model) on a Chevy G-Series (G20/G30) chassis.\n*   **Forensic Evidence:** User observed rust on window frame screws, which served as the \"smoking gun\" for internal damage (\"that's why we got rust on the window frame screws huh\").\n*   **Philosophical Approach:** The \"Forensic Confirmation\" methodology—treating surface rust as an \"entry wound\" rather than a cosmetic blemish.\n*   **Terminology/Jargon:** \"The Fleetwood Crunch\" (describing the structural failure of internal wood); \"Patient Zero\" (the window frame as the source of failure).\n*   **Tool Preferences:** Noted effectiveness of Butyl Tape for seals, Gorilla Glue for expanding/gap-filling properties, and mineral spirits for decontamination.\n*   **Upgrade Mindset:** User is advised to move beyond factory specifications (raw lumber) to \"Marine-grade\" or \"Epoxy-sealed\" components for a permanent fix.\n\n---\n\nNEXUS DEBRIEF COMPLETE.

TECHNICAL DNA\n   - **Architecture:** Headless terminal running under an invisible overlay.\n   - **Interaction:** Press hotkey (Ctrl+`) → Cursor appears at mouse position → Type command → Enter → Output displays in floating text → Auto-fade after 5-10 seconds.\n   - **Communication:** Uses PTY (Pseudo Terminal), pipes, or tmux session control for input/output tunneling.\n   - **Technology Choice:** Tauri (Rust + Web Frontend) selected over Electron for performance, native global hotkey support, and smaller bundle size.\n   - **Mapping:** Integration with Peacock’s XEdit-Path™ to map CLI errors directly to the source code for one-click fixes.\n\n4. CONSTRAINTS & RISKS\n   - **Security:** Modern OS security locks down global overlays; requires elevated permissions for global input capture.\n   - **Platform Variance:** Transparency handling differs significantly between Wayland and X11 on Linux.\n\n5.

PRIME DIRECTIVE\n   To create a systematic, disciplined, and reliable system for AI-assisted code development that eliminates the \"peacock\" inefficiencies of conversational chatbots by focusing on structured planning and precise refinement.\n\n2. CORE ENGINE\n   The application aims to be a \"functional tool\" that provides \"intel\" and performs \"operations\" rather than acting as a conversational companion. Success is defined by \"enabling reliable project progress and completion\" through two distinct modes: Ideation (planning) and Refinement (coding/iteration).\n\n3. TECHNICAL DNA\n   - **Architecture:** A three-tier system consisting of a Sublime Text Plugin (Trigger), an MCP (Main Control Point) local hub (Coordinator), and a stateless local LLM (Processor).\n   - **User Interface (Sublime Plugin):**\n     - Right-click context menu (\"LLM Hustle\") with submenus for specific \"plays\": Question, Fix, Explain, Rewrite, and Alternatives.\n     - Grabs selected text, identifies file language (syntax), and captures precise location data (filepath, line, column).\n     - Receives structured responses from the MCP and triggers system-default browser to open generated HTML reports.\n   - **Main Control Point (MCP) Hub:**\n     - A local Python service (using Flask) that acts as the \"Dispatcher\" and \"Translator.\"\n     - Receives JSON packages from the plugin: `{\"text\": \"...\", \"command\": \"...\", \"language\": \"...\", \"filepath\": \"...\"}`.\n     - **Ideation Mode:** Prompts a specialized LLM to act as a \"Project Planner\" to define Objectives and a Workflow Map without generating code prematurely.\n     - **Refinement Mode:** Crafts precise, context-rich prompts for the LLM using current snippets and historical intel.\n     - **Response Parsing:** An internal module that extracts structured data from the LLM’s text output (e.g., using markers like `Function:` or `---`).\n     - **HTML Backbone:** Generates persistent, hyperlinked HTML documentation of code analysis, stored in a `mcp_reports` directory and styled via an external CSS file (`report_styles.css`).\n     - **External Memory:** Loads previously saved HTML reports to feed historical context back into current LLM prompts, overcoming context window limits.\n   - **Execution Engine:** Communicates with local LLM APIs (Ollama via `/api/generate` or Llama.cpp) using JSON payloads.\n   - **Ghost Overlay Feature:** A proposed borderless, always-on-top, transparent window that ghosts command output over other applications for a set duration (e.g., 20 seconds) before fading.\n     - Includes a \"Recall\" hotkey to re-display the last output without re-running the command.\n     - Includes a \"Persistent View\" toggle.\n\n4. CONSTRAINTS & RISKS\n   - **Statelessness:** The LLM is a \"clean slate\" for every message; the MCP must manage all historical state externally.\n   - **Formatting Errors:** High risk identified by the user; system must never rely on LLM to generate perfect JSON; MCP must handle parsing of structured text.\n   - **Sublime Integration:** HTML rendering is not native to Sublime; requires external browser or complex custom logic.\n   - **Cross-Platform Overlay:** Achieving transparent \"click-through\" and global hotkeys is noted as technically difficult across X11, Wayland, and Windows.\n   - **Context Limits:** The system must intelligently extract *relevant* pieces of history to avoid overflowing the LLM’s working memory.\n\n5. INTEL VAULT: Non-Technical Assets for Later Extraction\n   - **Business Philosophy:** \"Anti-peacock\"—avoiding the \"lovable marketable human like friend\" trend in favor of raw utility and discipline.\n   - **Project Name Logic:** Named \"Peacock\" ironically to call out the competition's habit of showing off \"feathers\" (flashy features) without completing projects.\n   - **User Aspiration:** Aiming for a \"board meeting in Palo Alto\" level of strategy and an exit that allows for utilization of emerging tech without time or money limitations.\n   - **Psychological Insight:** \"Yes man\" chatbots cause user frustration and \"sanity\" loss by agreeing to mid-project scope changes they cannot handle.\n   - **Strategic Safeguard:** The AI should have the discipline to tell the user \"No\" and force a snapshot/restart if scope creep is detected.\n\n---\n\n### STRATEGIC BLUEPRINT: SASHA (Advanced Security Analysis Tool)\n\n1. PRIME DIRECTIVE\n   A comprehensive mobile application security toolkit designed to bridge static analysis and dynamic instrumentation into an automated, intelligence-driven workflow.\n\n2. CORE ENGINE\n   The goal is to \"slap objection out the water\" by combining Jadx decompilation with Frida dynamic hooking, recognizing security service provider patterns (Appdome, Firebase, SafetyNet) to provide \"ready-to-use solutions without requiring expertise.\"\n\n3. TECHNICAL DNA\n   - **Static Analysis (Jadx):**\n     - Automated decompilation of APKs in the `scripts/raw` directory.\n     - Scans for critical functions (TrustManager, CertificatePinner), root detection methods, and hardcoded secrets.\n   - **Dynamic Instrumentation (Frida):**\n     - Module `frida_launcher.py` for server management and launching processes.\n     - `script_handler.py` for managing, downloading, and tagging Frida scripts.\n     - Features for real-time function tracing and code injection via PID or Package Name.\n   - **Intelligence Layer (Database):**\n     - SQLite database (`scripts.db`) tracking original filenames, new filenames (logical categorization like `ssl-bypass-001.js`), and extracted features.\n     - Tracks \"Actions\" (hooks/bypasses) across multiple scripts to identify unique vs. common code patterns.\n   - **Automated Workflows:**\n     - Error handling that automatically moves failing scripts to a dedicated `/errors` directory.\n     - Feature matching: Recognizes if an app uses specific security firms and recommends tailored bypasses.\n     - \"Ghost\" mode: CLI list of apps excludes system processes by default.\n\n4. CONSTRAINTS & RISKS\n   - **Permissions:** Script often hits permission hurdles when creating folders or moving files in Linux environments.\n   - **Script Complexity:** The original user script was 253 lines; condensed AI versions risk losing edge-case logic.\n   - **Detection Risk:** Anti-tampering and Frida detection in high-security apps (Level 4/5) are significant hurdles.\n   - **Frida Stability:** Issues noted with `-v` flags and subprocess blocking during spawn commands.\n\n5. INTEL VAULT: Non-Technical Assets for Later Extraction\n   - **Monetization Strategy:** \"Outcome-based\" model; sell the results (bypass scripts/app analysis) rather than the tool. Keep the \"how\" and \"tools\" hidden in a black box.\n   - **Pricing Tiers:** 5-app/month subscription; pay-per-analysis ($50/app); $1,000+ Enterprise tier for high-tier clientele.\n   - **Competitive Edge:** Most current tools are \"Do It Yourself\" (Frida, Objection, Jadx); Sasha aims to be the \"expert assistant\" that removes the expertise requirement.\n   - **Brand Identity:** Named \"Sasha\" after the user’s daughter; chosen for its sleek, 5-letter brand potential (similar to Uber/Sony/Asus).\n   - **Observation:** \"80-90% of apps use the same security measures\"—overlap is high in specific domains (food, retail).\n\n---\n\n### STRATEGIC BLUEPRINT: ORM REPUTATION MANAGEMENT SYSTEM\n\n1.

TECHNICAL DNA\n   - **Content Engine:** 27+ unique blog posts generated from conversation logs covering tech strategy, philosophy, and personal growth.\n   - **Web Framework:** Astro (Static Site Generator) using the `personal-website` blog template.\n   - **Deployment Logic:** Bash script (`deploy_astro_site.sh`) using `lftp` to mirror the `./dist/` directory to multiple FTP groups.\n   - **Domain Roster:**\n     - Group 1: `trevino.today`, `blog.trevino.today`, `portfolio.trevino.today`, `resume.trevino.today`.\n     - Group 2: `getdome.pro`, `matt.getdome.pro`, `resume.getdome.pro`, `shop.getdome.pro`.\n     - Group 3: `4front.site`, `blog.4front.site`, `news.4front.site`, `news.4front.site`.\n   - **SEO/ORM Workflow:** Connect to Google Search Console; generate/submit `sitemap-index.xml`.\n\n4. CONSTRAINTS & RISKS\n   - **Index Speed:** Google Search Console may notify that sitemaps are not submitted, delaying indexing of \"burying\" content.\n   - **Authority Gap:** Negative links come from high-authority news sites (`cbsnews.com`), making them harder to suppress without massive content volume.\n   - **FTP Management:** Multiple sets of credentials (if0_37766858, if0_37766846, if0_37415143) and hostnames (`ftpupload.net`) to manage.\n\n5. INTEL VAULT: Non-Technical Assets for Later Extraction\n   - **Business Vision:** Helping people move forward in life after legal issues through \"second-chance narratives.\"\n   - **Target Segments:** Ex-felons rebuilding an image; small businesses recovering from bad reviews.\n   - **Personal Note:** The user felt a \"Natural Mystic\" or spiritual alignment when winning the hardware auction needed to run this project while simultaneously caring for his son.\n\n---\n\n### STRATEGIC BLUEPRINT: API SECURITY RECONNAISSANCE TOOL\n\n1.

TECHNICAL DNA\n   - **Web Session Analysis:** Imports Chrome DevTools data (`.har` files) to identify endpoints, HTTP methods, and authentication headers.\n   - **MobSF Integration:** Fetches data from MobSF APIs to cross-reference mobile vulnerabilities with web interaction findings.\n   - **Logic Engine:** Maps results to the OWASP API Top 10; identifies missing JWT/CSRF tokens.\n   - **Integration Pipeline:** Connects with Apktool, ApkLeaks, Kiterunner, Burp Suite, and Postman.\n   - **Scenario Modeling:** Provides hypothetical attack scenarios to illustrate how attackers obtain missing data elements.\n\n4. CONSTRAINTS & RISKS\n   - **Complexity:** Parsing large `.har` files and correctly correlating them with mobile binary behavior.\n   - **Dependency:** Heavily reliant on third-party tool output quality (MobSF/ApkLeaks).\n\n5. INTEL VAULT: Non-Technical Assets for Later Extraction\n   - **Aspirational Impact:** \"Forces a change in the way we think about and address API security vulnerabilities.\"\n   - **Marketing Goal:** Positioned as a \"Strategic Security Planning\" tool rather than just a scanner.\n\n---\n\n### STRATEGIC BLUEPRINT: VISIONARY PROJECT INCUBATOR (Niche Ideas Vault)\n\n1. PRIME DIRECTIVE\n   A conceptual roadmap of high-impact technologies designed to solve specific human, industrial, and social challenges.\n\n2. CORE ENGINE\n   Ideas harvested from the user's \"solid list\" (Items 3-14), categorized by market application.\n\n3.

PRIME DIRECTIVE\n   The core goal is to convert any gas-powered vehicle into a functional home generator for less than $200 to maintain critical utilities like heat and refrigeration during winter power outages.\n\n2. CORE ENGINE\n   The system functions by utilizing a vehicle's alternator to generate energy, storing it in the car battery, and then using an inverter to convert DC power into 110V AC power for home use. Success is defined by the ability to \"keep your house warm\" and \"keep your fridge on\" without the $500–$1,000 cost of a dedicated power station.\n\n3. TECHNICAL DNA\n   - **Power Conversion Hardware:** Renogy 1000W Pure Sine Wave Inverter (expandable to 1500W, 2000W, or 3000W depending on load).\n   - **Input Mechanism:** Heavy-duty battery clamps (purchased separately for ~$12) attached to inverter terminals: Negative to Black, Positive to Red.\n   - **Power Distribution:** Inverter features two 110V outlets and a USB port for extension cord connectivity.\n   - **Grid Isolation (Safety):** \n     - *Primary Method:* \"Easy Generator Switch\" ($88, UL-listed manual transfer switch) installed at the gas furnace to isolate the circuit from the grid.\n     - *Secondary Method:* DIY pigtail bypass (~$20) involving an outlet and a male-to-female extension cord connection to the furnace.\n   - **Load Management:** Specifically capable of powering a 110V gas furnace (powering the fan and control board) or a refrigerator.\n   - **Vehicle Integration:** Clamps attach directly to the vehicle battery; the inverter is housed under the hood during operation.\n\n4. CONSTRAINTS & RISKS\n   - **Environment/Safety:** The vehicle must never be run in an enclosed space (garage) due to carbon monoxide risks; must ensure adequate ventilation.\n   - **Security:** The setup allows the vehicle hood to be closed and locked to prevent theft of the inverter while in use.\n   - **Operational Limits:** Users must \"start the vehicle from time to time\" to prevent battery depletion; the inverter is limited by its rated wattage (e.g., 1000W).\n   - **Regulatory/Code:** The transcript notes that the DIY pigtail method \"might not be up to code in your area,\" whereas the Easy Generator Switch is UL-listed.\n   - **Fuel Consumption:** Requires monitoring of vehicle fuel levels during extended idling.\n\n5. INTEL VAULT: Non-Technical Assets for Later Extraction\n   - **Cost-Efficiency Intel:** The total setup costs under $200 (Inverter ~$149, Clamps ~$13, DIY Switch ~$20), significantly undercuting traditional generator costs.\n   - **Stealth Advantages:** A running car is \"so much quieter than a generator,\" providing a tactical advantage in emergency situations where a user might not want to advertise they have power (\"they can't listen for your car running\").\n   - **Market Context:** Renogy identified as a preferred brand for inverters; Mr. Cool identified as a sponsor for DIY HVAC equipment.\n   - **Consumer Psychology:** Folks are hesitant to spend $500–$1,000 on power stations; the \"car as a generator\" concept is framed as a \"trick\" to save money while remaining prepared.\n   - **Backstory/Experience:** User claims most vehicle time is spent idling anyway, dismissing concerns that idling is \"not good for the motor.\"\n   - **Future Tech Reference:** Mentions bidirectional charging (Vehicle-to-Home/V2H) is becoming standard in newer Electric Vehicles (EVs), potentially removing the need for external inverters.\n\n---\n\n### STRATEGIC BLUEPRINT: SINGLE-CIRCUIT FURNACE TRANSFER INTERFACE\n\n1.

Removes `/etc/X11/xorg.conf` and `modprobe.d` entries.\n   - **Conflict Resolution:** Identifies and removes overlapping DKMS modules (e.g., `nvidia/570.86.15` vs `nvidia-srv/535.230.02`).\n   - **Compiler Forcing:** Manually symlinks `/usr/bin/cc` to `/usr/bin/gcc-12` to ensure the NVIDIA kernel module build matches the kernel's compilation environment.\n   - **Docker Maintenance:** Uses `docker builder prune -a` to reclaim storage (e.g., 9.8GB found in transcript) from failed builds.\n   - **Stealth/Quiescent Mode:** Includes logic for silent driver installation without OpenGL files for pure compute environments.\n\n4. CONSTRAINTS & RISKS\n   - **Kernel Version:** System is running a high-version kernel (6.8.0-57-generic) which outpaces standard repo drivers (535).\n   - **Stability Risk:** \"Monitor turned off... could not get it back on\" - suggests that incorrect driver initialization can take down the host display server (Xorg).\n   - **Mismatch Danger:** Mixing compiler versions between kernel and modules results in \"subtle bugs that are difficult to diagnose.\"\n\n5. INTEL VAULT: Non-Technical Assets for Later Extraction\n   - **Operational Heuristics:** \"Always 1 step back while takin' a step forward.\" User views technical failures (like Docker connection errors) as a necessary part of the shakedown process.\n   - **Infrastructure Note:** Host machine is used as a combined workstation and server, leading to tension between display requirements and compute requirements.\n\nNEXUS DEBRIEF COMPLETE.
