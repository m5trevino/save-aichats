ACT AS: NEXUS (System Architect & Strategist).

THE MISSION:
We are building "PEACOCK V21" - A Tactical AI Orchestration Console.
We are rejecting the standard "Chat UI." We are building a "Live Circuit Board."

CORE PHILOSOPHY: "Form Follows Function."
1. The UI must visualize the actual logic flow.
2. No hidden "loading spinners." We show the gears turning.
3. If an API call is made, a line on the screen connects [USER] to [GATEWAY] and lights up.

THE EXECUTION PLAN:
PHASE 1: The Mechanic's Bay. Build a raw "Test Bench" with ugly buttons to prove the logic (API, DB, Batching) works.
PHASE 2: The Logic Map. Design the visual node graph.
PHASE 3: The Blueprint Layer. Clicking a node reveals its internal logic specs (Inputs, States, Data Flow).

YOUR OUTPUT:
Provide the high-level Architectural Map. Define the Nodes (Ingest, Wrap, Strike, Archive) and the connections between them.
